# Basic Calculator in Python

## Description

This repository contains a basic calculator script written in Python. The calculator supports the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can perform multiple calculations in one session and choose to exit when done.

## Features
  - **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers.
  -	**Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
  -	**Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers.
  -	**Division (/)**: Divides the first number by the second, with basic error handling for division by zero.

## Requirements
  - Python 3.x

## Usage
  1.	Clone the repository or download the script.
  2.	Run the script using (**in the correct directory**) the command:  *python3 calculator.py*
  3.	Enter the desired operation (+, -, *, /) when prompted.
  4.	Provide two numbers when asked, and the result will be displayed.
  5.	The program will ask if you’d like to perform another calculation. Type “yes” to continue or “no” to exit.

## Error Handling
  -	If an invalid number is entered, the program will ask for a valid number.
  -	If an invalid operation symbol is entered, the program will prompt the user to try again.
